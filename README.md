# Kitty Shell

The _kitty shell_ is a simple shell interface that runs both Linux and custom kitty-themed commands! 

This project reflects three core aspects of me:
1. My unwavering love for my friendly feline friends!
2. My desire to apply the C programming language in a new manner (aside from algorithms)
3. My interest in operating systems (cultivated by my university's course offerings)

Indeed, this was a basic, light-hearted extension beyond my course that not only helped me navigate the intricacies of C, but also deepened my appreciation for the language. As such, please treat this project as more of a fun endeavour (if anything).
